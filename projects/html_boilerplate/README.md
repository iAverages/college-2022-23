When starting a new project, developers often have "boilerplate code" that they use which contains a basic framework for their project. Think of it as a template, sometimes with some regularly used functions already included, or with comments to remind them how to use particular code.

It would be a good idea to develop a set of boilerplate code files for HTML and CSS and add these to your Github.

[Here](https://simpledev.io/html/html-boilerplate-code/) is a website with some tips on setting up a HTML boilerplate file.

Create your boilerplate code files and add them to Github and take a screenshot as evidence to add to your OneNote page.
